Here is a screenshot of me using the notepad feature on my laptop in order to create a file named config. One problem that I faced during this time was the extension name. Originally, the file was named "config.txt" and this caused many problems within the code.

During Lab 6, I had found out that we needed to complete Group Choice #2 and set up the git commands in order to push the updates in our markdown-parser-main folder on the cmd line.
