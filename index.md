Here is a screenshot of me using the notepad feature on my laptop in order to create a file named config. One problem that I faced during this time was the extension name. Originally, the file was named "config.txt" and this caused many problems within the code.

## What is a discover yearly?

If one is familiar with the app Spotify, there is a specific playlist named "Discover Weekly.
